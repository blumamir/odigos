    If you have Docker installed, you can run Odigos CLI using Docker:

    ```bash
    docker run --rm -v ~/.kube:/home/nonroot/.kube --network host keyval/odigos-cli:latest
    ```
    The --rm flag will remove the container after the command is executed to avoid cluttering your system.
    The -v flag will mount your local kube config file to the container so that Odigos can access your cluster.
    The --network host flag will allow the container to access your local network so that you can access kubernetes api server.
