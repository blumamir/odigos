In this tutorial, we are going to use Odigos for generating distributes traces for an application written in Go.

We are going to deploy the application on a virtual machine and use Jaeger as the backend for storing and visualizing the traces.

## Preparing the environment

- A Linux machine with debian or red hat based distribution.

## Deploying the Target Application

We are going to install a subset of odigos [demo application](https://github.com/odigos-io/simple-demo) that consists of 1 microservices written in Go.

Deploy the application using the following commands:

1. Add the odigos repository to your package manager:

```shell
sudo mkdir -p /etc/apt/keyrings/
wget -q -O - https://apt.fury.io/odigos/gpg.key | gpg --dearmor | sudo tee /etc/apt/keyrings/odigos.gpg > /dev/null
deb [signed-by=/etc/apt/keyrings/odigos.gpg] https://apt.fury.io/odigos/ * *
```

2. Update the package manager:

```shell
sudo apt update
```

3. Install the demo application:

```shell
sudo apt install membership
```

4. Check that the application is running:

```shell
sudo systemctl status membership
```

## Deploying Jaeger

This Jaeger setup is just for demonstration purposes. In a production environment, you would deploy Jaeger in a more robust way.

Install Jaeger using the following commands:

1. Download a version of Jaeger which is compatible to your OS and arch from [GitHub releases page](https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases).
For example, to download version `1.57.0` for linux amd64:

```shell
wget https://github.com/jaegertracing/jaeger/releases/download/v1.57.0/jaeger-1.57.0-linux-amd64.tar.gz
```

2. Extract the downloaded archive:

```shell
tar -xvf jaeger-<version>-linux-<arch>.tar.gz
cd jaeger-<version>-linux-<arch>
```

3. Run the Jaeger All-in-One binary:

```shell
./jaeger-all-in-one --collector.otlp.grpc.host-port 0.0.0.0:44317 --collector.otlp.http.host-port 0.0.0.0:44318
```

We map the otlp endpoints for Jaeger to different ports (44317\44318 instead of 4317\4318) to avoid conflicts with odigos collector.

4. Browse to Jaeger UI at `http://localhost:16686`. Replace `localhost` with the IP address of the machine where Jaeger is running if you are accessing it from a different machine.

At this point, jaeger is running and ready to receive traces from the demo application.
