A "Source" in Odigos is any service or software that are able to produce telemetry signals.

Odigos is about connecting sources which record spans (traces) metrics and logs, and exporting this observability data to destinations (Observability Backends).
Sources in Odigos for Kuberenetes are: Deployments, DaemonSets and StatefulSets.

## Instrumentation

The process of instrumentation is adding code to sources to produce telemetry signals.
The instrumentation code will then record data about the runtime behavior of the service.

## Odigos Auto Instrumentation

Odigos can automatically instrument your sources with opentelemetry.
