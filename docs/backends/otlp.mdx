## Configuring Generic OTLP gRPC Backend

For advanced users trying to implement complex observability pipelines, Odigos support sending data to any OTLP gRPC unencrypted endpoint.

If your destination is supported natively in Odigos its recommended to use the native integration.

## Configuration

The only required configuration is the endpoint of the OTLP gRPC server. Note that odigos only supports unencrypted endpoints (no tls).

The endpoint format is `host:port`. 
- host is required
- port is optional and defaults to the default OTLP gRPC port `4317`.

<Tip>
  Can't find your destination in Odigos? Please tell us! We are constantly
  adding new integrations.
