Chronosphere is a monitoring and observability platform that provides a scalable, reliable, and cost-effective way to collect, store, and analyze metrics and traces.
To send data from Odigos to Chronosphere, [you need to have an account with Chronosphere](https://chronosphere.io/demo-request/) and configure the Chronosphere destination in Odigos with the following details:

- **Chronosphere Company Domain** - Your company domain can be found in the URL of the Chronosphere UI. 
For example, if your URL is `https://demo-sandbox.chronosphere.io/`, then your company domain is `demo-sandbox`. 

- **API Token** - To create your API token for sending data from odigos to Chronosphere, you should login to your Chronosphere admin account click the `Platform` menu on the left side of the screen, then click `Service Accounts` and create a new service account.
