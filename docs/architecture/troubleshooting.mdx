If you selected a workload to auto instrument and you do not see any data, use the checklist below to troubleshoot the issue. 
It is recommended to use the `odigos describe` command to get detailed information in one command.

### 1. Odigos Instrumentation Label

Ensure that the workload has the `odigos-instrumentation` label set and equals to `enabled`, or that the label is missing and the namespace is labeled accordingly.

The label is either set by the UI when used, manually integrated into the manifest, or set by the user using the `kubectl`, `helm` or similar tools.

### 2. Odigos Instrumentation Config

Ensure that the `instrumentationconfig.odigos.io` object exists for the workload.

- `name`: concatenated from the lowercase workload kind and name. for example: `deployment-myservice`.
- `namespace`: the namespace of the workload.

Example:

```bash
kubectl get instrumentationconfigs.odigos.io deployment-myservice -n default -o yaml
```

The object creating might take few seconds after the label is set.
If the object is missing, check the `odigos-instrumentor` logs in the `odigos-system` namespace for any errors.

### 3. Odigos Instrumented Application

Check that `instrumentedapplication.odigos.io` object exists for the workload.

- `name`: concatenated from the lowercase workload kind and name. for example: `deployment-myservice`.
- `namespace`: the namespace of the workload.

Example:

```bash
kubectl get instrumentedapplications.odigos.io deployment-myservice -n default -o yaml
```

Verify that the `instrumentedapplication.odigos.io` contains the containers and programming language.
If the object is missing, check the `odiglet` logs in the `odigos-system` namespace on a node that runs a pod of the workload.


### 4. Odigos Instrumentation Devices

Ensure that the pod spec for the workload contains the instrumentation devices under the `resource.limits` section for the relevant containers.

```bash
kubectl get deployment myservice -o jsonpath='{.spec.template.spec.containers[*].resources.limits}'
```

If the instrumentation devices are missing, check the `odigos-instrumentor` logs in the `odigos-system` namespace for any errors.

### 5. Verify Pods Restarted

Ensure that the pods of the workload have been restarted after the instrumentation devices were added to the pod spec.

```bash
kubectl get pods -l app=myservice
```

If the pods have not been restarted, or if they fail to start, or are stuck in a crash loop, check the pod logs for any errors.
