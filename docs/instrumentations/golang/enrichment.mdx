Odigos will automatically instrument your Go services and record spans from common modules.
To enrich your traces with additional spans for your custom business logic operations, use the OpenTelemetry API.

## Required dependencies

Add the following dependencies to your project by running:

```bash
go get go.opentelemetry.io/otel \
  go.opentelemetry.io/otel/trace
```

## Creating Spans

To create a span, you need to create a `Tracer` and use it to start a new span.
The following example demonstrates how to create a span using the OpenTelemetry Go API.

```go
package main

import (
    "context"
    "go.opentelemetry.io/otel"
)

var tracer = otel.Tracer("trace-example")

func my_function(ctx context.Context) {
    _, span := tracer.Start(ctx, "my_function")
    // Do some work
    defer span.End()
}
```
