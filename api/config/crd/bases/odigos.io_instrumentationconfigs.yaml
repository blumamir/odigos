                              and the fraction is used to determine the sampling decision.
                              If any of the attribute compare samplers evaluate to false,
                              the fraction is not used and the rule is skipped.
                              An "empty" AttributesAndSamplerRule with no attribute conditions is considered to always evaluate to true.
